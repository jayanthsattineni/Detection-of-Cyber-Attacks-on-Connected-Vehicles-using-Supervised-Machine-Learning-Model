# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Model
This project aims to explore datasets extracted from the in-vehicle network on an in-motion vehicle, 
develop supervised machine learning models, and analyze their performance to detect whether the vehicle
is under attack or not at different time steps. The dataset contains three scenarios: normal driving, 
spoofing the speed reading, and spoofing the RPM reading, collected from the CAN bus of a vehicle.
